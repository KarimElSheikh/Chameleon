# Chameleon
A 3D game made in Unity where you control a sphere that is moving on a track and trying to match colors.

## How to play
Just download and extract the zip archive **Chameleon.zip** to any folder, and then launch the game using **Chameleon.exe**.

## Gameplay
The goal of the game is to change the color of the sphere so that it is the same as the color of the ground it
is currently in. Throughout the game the player collects cubes that add to their score. When a player enters a
ground and fails to match its color, they lose half of their score.

The player loses if their score reaches zero at any point of the game.

The track is divided horizontally into different colors (Red, Blue, Green, Grey) and divided vertically into 3
lanes (Left, Middle, Right).

The Grey ground accepts any color of the sphere.

The player can collect a small Purple Cube that changes the track in sight to Grey.
As the game goes on, the sphere rolls faster and faster...
